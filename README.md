# Boundary-Layer-Program
This MATLAB computer program solves the two-dimensional steady state boundary layer equations with general fluid properties for compressible flows in the ideal gas or non-ideal gas (departing from ideal gas) regime, adiabatic or including heat transfer for laminar and/or turbulent (algebraic CS-model) flows.
